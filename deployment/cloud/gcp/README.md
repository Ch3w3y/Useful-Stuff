# GCP Deployment Templates for Data Science

A comprehensive collection of Docker-based deployment templates for Google Cloud Platform, designed for data scientists working with R, Python, and SQL. Each template follows security best practices and includes production-ready configurations.

## 🔐 Security First Approach

All templates implement:
- Service account authentication with minimal required permissions
- Environment variable management for secrets
- Network security configurations
- Container security best practices
- IAM role separation
- Encrypted storage and transmission

## 📁 Template Structure

### R Environments
- **`r-script-runner/`** - Containerized R script execution with GCS integration
- **`shiny-app/`** - Production Shiny application deployment
- **`rmarkdown-reports/`** - Automated report generation and distribution
- **`r-bigquery-etl/`** - R-based BigQuery ETL pipelines

### Python Environments
- **`jupyter-notebook/`** - Secure Jupyter deployment with persistent storage
- **`python-etl/`** - Python-based data processing pipelines
- **`flask-webapp/`** - Flask web application deployment

### SQL Pipelines
- **`bigquery-sql-etl/`** - Pure SQL ETL with scheduling
- **`stored-procedures/`** - BigQuery stored procedure automation

### Orchestration & CI/CD
- **`airflow/`** - Apache Airflow for workflow orchestration
- **`jenkins/`** - Jenkins CI/CD for automated deployments
- **`cloud-functions/`** - Serverless function templates

### Security & IAM
- **`security/`** - Service account templates and IAM policies

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Choose your template** based on use case
2. **Copy the template folder** to your project
